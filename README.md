# Zebra DataWedge Barcode API integration demo

This DWApp is for demo purposes, it's untested for production environments. It uses a Zebra `DataWedge` profile with an Android intent for the barcode scanning redirection.

The staging phase of the `DataWedge` profile is found [here](https://anonfiles.com/defeWe23z2/dwprofile_CustomProfile_db). You'll need to place your profile file inside the `C:\datawedge` directory, and the name of the file `dwprofile_CustomProfile.db`. Once the file is set up, you can use `Zebra StageNow` to provision your complete configuration prior to the app installation and usage.
